# Changelog

## 0.4.0 - unreleased

- Prepare a new owner-authorized OpenAI draft with the portable `voicedot` identity and explicit OAuth DCR; preserve the older unsubmitted entry separately.

- Add visible preview references for confirmed replies, review rounds and bulk resolutions across turns; preserve exact content, latest-preview checks and safe reply retries.
- Mirror all 29 current MCP tools with exact schemas, scopes and annotations; derive submission flags from the mirror and detect runtime drift.
- Update the skill for project addresses, Team/Public handovers, human review rounds, live permissions and confirmed reply retries.
- Document separate CLI v2 account setup, human identity verification and first feedback.
- Replace historical review cases with Harbor Notes and Fieldwork Notes; keep the authorized reply rehearsal separate.
- Keep submission pending actual reviewer, desktop/mobile, video, domain and portal acceptance.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-07

- Describe creating a project in an existing owned workspace with the separate `projects:create` permission, durable retry protection, and widget installation verification for an exact HTTPS origin and port (`create_project`, `get_project_installation`, `get_project_installation_status`).
- Run every reviewer case in English on the synthetic Atlas Checkout page; marketplace submission stays on hold.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-29

- Align the canonical skill and OpenAI listing with VoiceDot's optional page-pin status, discussion resolve, and reply tools.
- Add public submission metadata, reviewer case drafts, a production brand icon, and a deterministic ZIP for OpenAI Platform upload.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-08-19

- Correct release-candidate dynamic-state coverage and derive versioned package artifacts from canonical metadata.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-19

- Add portable Agent Plugins 1.0.0 metadata, one canonical review skill, and generated OpenAI/Codex compatibility artifacts.
- Add a generated Claude Code adapter with drift checks; no marketplace publication claim.
